# Space Playground
A Unity 3D project simulating our Solar System, allowing for exploration of the cosmos.

Originially ported from my Swift Student Challenge Award-winning Swift Playground. This experience will bring you around the Solar System while sharing interesting information about our Sun and the planets.

All planets and stars rotate and orbit at their real-life speeds (time passed can be increased in settings to visualize planet rotations)
